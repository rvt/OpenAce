More about FLARM projection of aircraft trajectory into the future

Further examination of what FLARM transmits shows that:

* The time interval between the projected velocities varies: For gliders it is normally 2 seconds, not 3.  But when established in tight circling it is 3 seconds.  For towplanes it is 4 seconds.  For other aircraft types it remains to be determined.

* The coordinates (lat/lon) transmitted as the current position are actually the projected position 2 seconds from now.  That is true even when the interval between projected points is 3 seconds.

* The direction of travel in the first projected velocity is computed for a point in time later than now.  It appears to be time=now+interval with the same interval as is used between projected velocities.  Thus, it may be a different point in time than for the coordinates sent.

* The "unk2" 2-bit field in the transmitted packet holds the following values: 1 normally, 0 if circling right, 3 if circling left, 2 if the data for horizontal or vertical speed is implausible.
